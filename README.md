Basic html script maker initially written by Adam Elwood 

Run the script makeHtml.py on a directory in your website folders to recursively go through and add images.html in each directory with images.

Example command:

```python makeHtml.py -i path/to/top/of/dir -t png```

Also supports pdf (if you view it in safari)
